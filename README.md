# Decidim on Docker

You'll find here the files used to build my Docker image for [decidim, free Open-Source participatory democracy for cities and organizations](https://decidim.org).

## Features

* SSL/https support on port 8443 with custom SSL certificates, or automatic openssl generation
* All official decidim modules installed

> including optional _decidim-consultations_ and _decidim-initiatives_, with cronjobs configured for _decidim-initiatives_ to run every 30 mns

* Able to run as non root user (must be root group), so works in OKD, or OpenShift, Kubernetes
* Mail sending via SMTP with SSL
* All available languages activated (en, ar, ca, de, es, eu, fi, fr, gl, hu, id, it, nl, no, pl, pt, ru, sv, tr, uk)
* Working outside the box with no complex config
* Latest decidim version (check tags)
* Daily run of metrics and open-data export
* OAuth (Facebook, Twitter, Google, CAS) support, with automatic activation
* Highly customizable with environment variables
* Ability to run your init scripts before starting the server

## How does it work ?

Feel free to check the Dockerfile to see how the image is built, and the entrycheck script to see what's executed inside your container when you run it.
